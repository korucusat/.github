# KorucuSat-2
---
The students on the Small Satellite Research & Development Team, a subsection of the Astronomy Society of Fulton Science Academy, are developing a novel satellite design, KorucuSAT-2–a cube satellite that will test advanced devices for space research. This marks our second satellite design, fully researched, engineered, and built by our students.
The previous design, KorucuSAT-1, focused on studying the ionosphere’s upper F2 layer using a spectrometer to detect soft X-rays from the sun and a magnetometer to monitor magnetic field fluctuations. This type of data is vital for understanding satellite communications and radio wave propagation. Our proposal underwent rigorous feasibility reviews from scholars at MIT, Harvard, USC, UGA, Georgia Tech, Cal Poly, the University of Stuttgart, and NASA JLP engineers. While NASA paused its CubeSat Launch Initiative grants this year, we are determined to continue advancing this mission when the program resumes.
This year, members of the team attended the Small Satellite Conference at Salt Lake City, Utah. It marked the largest and most prestigious group of scientists, engineers, and industry leaders in space. At the conference, we proudly presented our design and development as a student poster. While there, we connected with numerous companies, including a launch company.
We are thrilled to announce that we have officially signed a launch contract with Interstellar Technologies, a private Japanese launch service company. This historic partnership will send KorucuSAT-2 into orbit in early 2027. For a high school team, this is an extraordinary achievement and our team views it as another amazing milestone.
Building a CubeSat is an unparalleled educational opportunity, as it allows students to solve practical engineering challenges. Students go well beyond learning theory and apply current research breakthroughs to their work, manage complex subsystems and integration, and build technology to fit the intense mission parameters required for satellites to function in space.
Students need your help turning this framework and development into a reality. The cost of developing, testing, and preparing KorucuSAT-2 is $45,000. Our students are working hard to self-fundraise by running summer camps and outreach programs. Now we invite you to partner with us in making history.
We are also delighted to share exciting news: a FSA family has generously pledged to match every donation, dollar for dollar, up to $15,000. This means your gift goes twice as far. If your employer offers a matching program, your contribution could be tripled and provide three times the impact.
Donations not only aid in producing the satellite, they help us develop and train our team: the software engineers, computer science developers, aerospace engineers, and innovators of the future. 
For any questions, please contact Dr. Ramin Adams at rahmadoghlu@fultonscienceacademy.org
Thank you for believing in our mission.
